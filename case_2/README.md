The query's goal is to find the top 5 most recent visits to the Neurology department by patients over 50 who had at least 3 symptoms.

-----

```sql
SELECT
    p.name AS "patients.name",
    p.age AS "patients.age",
    v.visit_date AS "visits.visit_date",
    COUNT(s.id) AS symptom_count
```

  * **`SELECT`**: This clause specifies which columns to display in the final output.
  * **`p.name`, `p.age`, `v.visit_date`**: We are selecting the patient's name and age from the `patients` table (aliased as `p`) and the visit date from the `visits` table (aliased as `v`).
  * **`COUNT(s.id) AS symptom_count`**: This is an aggregate function. It counts the number of symptom IDs (from the `symptoms` table, aliased as `s`) associated with each visit. `AS symptom_count` renames this calculated column to match the requirement.

-----

```sql
FROM
    visits v
JOIN
    patients p ON v.patient_id = p.id
JOIN
    symptoms s ON v.id = s.visit_id
```

  * **`FROM visits v`**: We start with the `visits` table (aliased as `v`) as the central point of our query (we are looking for visits).
  * **`JOIN patients p ON v.patient_id = p.id`**: We join the `patients` table (aliased as `p`). We link each row in `visits` to its corresponding row in `patients` using the `patient_id` foreign key. This allows us to access `p.name` and `p.age`.
  * **`JOIN symptoms s ON v.id = s.visit_id`**: We join the `symptoms` table (aliased as `s`). We link each symptom to its specific visit using the `visit_id` foreign key. This allows us to count the symptoms for each visit.

-----

```sql
WHERE
    -- 1. Filter department
    v.department = 'Neurology'
    -- 2. Filter patient age
    AND p.age > 50
```

  * **`WHERE`**: This clause filters rows *before* any grouping occurs. This is highly efficient as it reduces the number of rows to be processed.
  * **`v.department = 'Neurology'`**: This is the first criterion. We only want visits to the 'Neurology' department.
  * **`AND p.age > 50`**: This is the second criterion. The patient must be older than 50 years old.

-----

```sql
GROUP BY
    v.id, -- Group by visit to count symptoms per visit
    p.name,
    p.age,
    v.visit_date
```

  * **`GROUP BY`**: This clause is essential because we used the `COUNT()` aggregate function. We must tell SQL how to bundle the rows before counting.
  * **`v.id`**: We group by the unique visit ID. This ensures that `COUNT(s.id)` will count all symptoms *for that one specific visit*.
  * **`p.name, p.age, v.visit_date`**: In standard SQL, any column in the `SELECT` list that is *not* an aggregate function (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, etc.) must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.

-----

```sql
HAVING
    -- 3. Filter symptom count (after grouping)
    COUNT(s.id) >= 3
```

  * **`HAVING`**: This clause filters *after* the `GROUP BY` has been applied. `WHERE` filters rows, `HAVING` filters groups.
  * **`COUNT(s.id) >= 3`**: This is our third criterion. We only want to keep the groups (visits) that have 3 or more symptoms.

-----

```sql
ORDER BY
    -- 4. Sort by most recent visit
    v.visit_date DESC
LIMIT 5; -- 5. Get top 5
```

  * **`ORDER BY v.visit_date DESC`**: We sort the final results by the visit date. `DESC` (descending) means from newest to oldest, fulfilling the "most recent" requirement.
  * **`LIMIT 5`**: Finally, after sorting, we take only the top 5 rows from the result set.
